 1.Check initial value = Look at i value = 1
 2.Check condition for i check condition True i is less than 10

 3. go into Loop body: and execute the current code = 1

 3. Updation = add into i(1) i++ and it will be ==  2

 3. Go in condition statemnt and see i = 2 and 2 is less than 10 so
 4. Loop body = Cout updated value(2) of i(make sure that in loop body you don't write i++ again) 

 4. then again update the value i++ = 3
 5. do the same loop again
 6. til the condtion false
